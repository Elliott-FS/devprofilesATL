Rememmber to use python -m pip install django when installing django in ubuntu.
"python3 manage.py runserver" runs server from my ubuntu terminal.
From top folder run source djangoenv/bin/activate to turn on venv from my terminal. 
"python3 manage.py makemigrations/python3 manage.py migrate" to make and send migrations from my terminal. 
Need to redo some data had to revert some migrations and fix bad data re-add projects from admin panel
